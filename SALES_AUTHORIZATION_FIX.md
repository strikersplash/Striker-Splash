# Sales User Authorization Fix Summary

## Issue

Sales users were getting "Unauthorized access" errors when trying to process transactions in the cashier interface.

## Root Cause

Multiple controller functions in `transactionController.ts` had hardcoded authorization that only allowed "admin" and "staff" roles, excluding "sales" users.

## Functions Fixed

### ✅ Updated to Include Sales Users:

1. **`processPurchaseKicks`** (Line ~465)

   - **Purpose**: Process kicks purchases (main sales functionality)
   - **Change**: Added sales role to authorization check
   - **Reason**: Sales users need to be able to sell kicks

2. **`processQRScan`** (Line ~86)

   - **Purpose**: Process QR code scans to identify players
   - **Change**: Added sales role to authorization check
   - **Reason**: Sales users need to scan player QR codes

3. **`processKicksPurchase`** (Line ~174)

   - **Purpose**: Alternative kicks purchase processing
   - **Change**: Added sales role to authorization check
   - **Reason**: Sales users need kicks purchase functionality

4. **`getTodaysTransactions`** (Line ~720)
   - **Purpose**: Fetch today's transaction history
   - **Change**: Added sales role to authorization check
   - **Reason**: Sales users should see transaction history

### ❌ Left Staff-Only (Security):

1. **`processReQueue`** (Line ~297)

   - **Purpose**: Requeue players in the system
   - **Reason**: Sales users shouldn't have requeue permissions

2. **`processRequeue`** (Line ~592)

   - **Purpose**: Another requeue function for cashier interface
   - **Reason**: Sales users shouldn't have requeue permissions

3. **`processCreditTransfer`** (Line ~398)
   - **Purpose**: Transfer credits between accounts
   - **Reason**: Sensitive financial operation, staff-only

## Authorization Pattern Used

**Before (Staff-only):**

```typescript
if (
  !(req.session as any).user ||
  ((req.session as any).user.role !== "admin" &&
    (req.session as any).user.role !== "staff")
) {
  res.status(401).json({ success: false, message: "Unauthorized access" });
  return;
}
```

**After (Including Sales):**

```typescript
if (
  !(req.session as any).user ||
  ((req.session as any).user.role !== "admin" &&
    (req.session as any).user.role !== "staff" &&
    (req.session as any).user.role !== "sales")
) {
  res.status(401).json({ success: false, message: "Unauthorized access" });
  return;
}
```

## Result

✅ Sales users can now:

- Scan QR codes to identify players
- Process kicks purchases/sales
- View transaction history
- Access all basic cashier functionality

❌ Sales users still cannot:

- Requeue players (security restriction)
- Transfer credits (security restriction)
- Access staff-only administrative functions

## Testing

- Server builds and starts successfully
- Application accessible at http://localhost:3000
- Sales users should now be able to complete transactions without "Unauthorized access" errors
