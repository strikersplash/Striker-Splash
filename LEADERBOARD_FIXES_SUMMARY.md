# Leaderboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sort Filter Added to Disabled Filters

We've updated the `disableIndividualOnlyFilters` function to properly handle the sort filter separately. Now, when viewing team leaderboards, the sort filter is properly disabled and greyed out along with the other individual-specific filters (gender, age, district).

```javascript
// Define which filters should be disabled for team view
const individualOnlyFilters = [
  "gender-filter",
  "age-filter",
  "district-filter",
];

// Always disable sort filter separately - it has special handling
const sortFilter = document.getElementById("sort-filter");
if (sortFilter) {
  if (disable) {
    sortFilter.disabled = true;
    sortFilter.parentElement.classList.add("text-muted");
    sortFilter.title = "This filter is only available for individual players";
  } else {
    sortFilter.disabled = false;
    sortFilter.parentElement.classList.remove("text-muted");
    sortFilter.removeAttribute("title");
  }
}
```

### 2. Debug JavaScript Code Fix

For the debug JavaScript appearing in the HTML, we created several tools to identify and fix this issue:

1. A script to identify any JavaScript code appearing outside proper script tags
2. A script to specifically check the leaderboard files for issues
3. A comprehensive EJS template checker

The issue appears to be intermittent and related to how the server processes and renders the templates. To fix it permanently:

1. Make sure all JavaScript in templates is properly enclosed in `<script>` tags
2. Check for any middleware that might be incorrectly injecting debug code
3. Consider adding a production flag that disables all debug logging in templates

## Next Steps

To permanently resolve the debug code issue:

1. Update your Express configuration to ensure proper EJS rendering
2. Add a global error handler for EJS rendering
3. Consider running the application in production mode to disable debug output
4. Monitor the issue after deployment to ensure it doesn't reappear

To test the fixes:

1. Run the application and navigate to the leaderboard page
2. Toggle between individual and team views
3. Verify that the sort filter is properly disabled when viewing teams
4. Check the page source to ensure no debug JavaScript appears in the HTML
