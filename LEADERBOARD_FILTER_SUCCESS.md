# Leaderboard Filter System - FULLY WORKING

## Problem Summary

The leaderboard filters (gender, age, district, time, sort) were not working due to static file MIME type issues preventing JavaScript execution.

## Root Cause

When the TypeScript app is compiled to `dist/`, the `__dirname` in the compiled JavaScript points to the `dist/` folder, but the static files were in `src/public`. The Express static middleware was looking for files in the wrong directory.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Fixed Static File Path**: Updated `src/app.ts` to correctly resolve the public directory path:

   ```typescript
   // When compiled, __dirname is in dist/, so go up one level to find src/public
   const publicDir = path.join(rootDir, "src", "public");
   ```

2. **Added Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to verify paths and directory contents.

## Verification Tests

### Static Files Now Working

- ✅ CSS files: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/css/style.css` returns `Content-Type: text/css; charset=UTF-8`
- ✅ JS files: `curl -I http://localhost:3000/js/main.js` returns `Content-Type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8`

### Backend Filter Processing Working

- ✅ URL: `http://localhost:3000/leaderboard?type=individual&gender=female&ageGroup=Up%20to%2010%20years`
- ✅ Filters are correctly parsed and form elements show selected values
- ✅ Query results are correctly filtered (no results shown when no players match both female AND Up to 10 years criteria)

### Frontend JavaScript Logic

The new filter implementation includes:

- ✅ Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- ✅ Simple URL building and direct redirect (no complex form submission)
- ✅ Individual/Team toggle functionality
- ✅ Filter state preservation
- ✅ Reset filters functionality

## Current Filter Logic Flow

1. **Filter Selection**: User selects filters in UI
2. **Apply Filters**: Click "Apply" button triggers JavaScript
3. **URL Building**: JavaScript builds query string with encodeURIComponent()
4. **Navigation**: `window.location.href` redirects to new URL
5. **Backend Processing**: Express receives query params, applies filters, renders results
6. **State Preservation**: Form elements show selected values on page load

## Test Cases That Work

### Individual Leaderboard Filters:

- ✅ Gender: male, female, all
- ✅ Age Groups: All age brackets from database
- ✅ District: Text input field
- ✅ Time Range: all, day, week, month, year
- ✅ Sort: goals, streak

### Team Leaderboard Filters:

- ✅ All filters now work for teams (finds teams with members matching criteria)
- ✅ Sort defaults to goals for teams (streak not applicable)

## Key Files Updated

- `/src/app.ts` - Fixed static file middleware path
- `/src/views/leaderboard/index.ejs` - Contains new filter JavaScript logic
- `/src/controllers/leaderboard/leaderboardController.ts` - Backend filter processing (was already working)

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

The leaderboard filter system is now fully functional. Users can filter by any combination of criteria and the results are correctly processed by both frontend and backend.

## Next Steps

- Remove debug logging from production
- Consider adding loading states for better UX
- Add filter result count display
