# Team Interface Fixes

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Removed "Compare Teams" Feature

- Removed the "Compare Teams" button from the team dashboard quick actions
- This feature was causing confusion and was not fully implemented

### 2. Fixed Duplicate Teams in Browse Page

- Teams were appearing twice in the browse teams page due to duplicate entries in team_stats table
- Modified the `Team.getAll()` method to use `DISTINCT ON` to ensure each team appears only once
- Added filter to only join with global team stats (where competition_id IS NULL)
- Used proper ordering to ensure consistent results

### 3. Improved Team Stats Retrieval

- Enhanced the `getTeamStats()` method to prioritize global team stats
- Added fallback to calculate stats from the `custom_competition_activity` table if no global stats exist
- This ensures accurate team statistics are displayed on the dashboard

## Technical Implementation

- Used SQL's `DISTINCT ON` feature to remove duplicates
- Added proper filtering to join with the correct team_stats records
- Added fallback data retrieval from `custom_competition_activity` for complete stats

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding a scheduled job to ensure team_stats remains in sync with activity data
- Add proper error handling for team stats calculation
- Potentially refactor the team stats system to be more consistent across the application
