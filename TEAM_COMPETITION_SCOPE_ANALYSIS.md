# Create Team Competition Button - Root Cause Analysis

## Issue Identified

Based on the console logs, the "Create Team Competition" button **IS WORKING** but failing validation. Here's what's happening:

1. ✅ **Form submission works** - "Team form submitted!" appears multiple times
2. ✅ **Validation function runs** - "validateAndCreateTeamCompetition called" appears
3. ✅ **Form values are correct** - teamSize: 5, cost: 15, kicks: 5, maxTeams: 2
4. ❌ **Teams array is empty** - The validation stops at the "selectedTeams.length < 2" check

## Root Cause

The `selectedTeams` array appears to be empty when the validation runs, even though the UI shows 2 teams. This suggests a **scope issue** - the `selectedTeams` variable used in the validation function is different from the one being populated by `addTeam()`.

## Evidence from Logs

- **Teams are being added**: "Adding team: Object { id: 1, name: "Ace Strikers" }" appears
- **Form values are read correctly**: All form inputs are working
- **No validation error messages**: The function silently fails the team count check

## Solution Required

The issue is likely that `selectedTeams` is declared in a different scope. We need to ensure that:

1. **Same variable reference**: The `selectedTeams` array used in `addTeam()` is the same one checked in `validateAndCreateTeamCompetition()`
2. **Global access**: Make `selectedTeams` accessible across all functions
3. **Debug verification**: Add logging to confirm the array state when validation runs

## Debugging Added

I've added console logs to:

- Show `selectedTeams` array content and length in the validation function
- Show when teams are added and the resulting array length
- Verify the array state at key moments

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the server** to apply the new debugging
2. **Test adding teams** and check console for "Team added to selectedTeams"
3. **Try creating competition** and check what `selectedTeams` shows in validation
4. **Fix scope issue** based on what the debugging reveals

## Expected Fix

The fix will likely involve ensuring all functions reference the same `selectedTeams` variable, possibly by:

- Moving the variable declaration to a more global scope
- Passing the array as a parameter
- Using a different variable management approach

The good news is that the button click mechanism is working perfectly - it's just a data scope issue to resolve.
