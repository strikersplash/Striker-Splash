# Team Goal Logging Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Console Log Cleanup**

   - Removed excessive console.log statements from the update functions
   - Improved readability and reduced browser console clutter

2. **Error Handling**

   - Added try-catch block around UI updates to prevent failure cascades
   - Ensures that refreshCompetitionData still runs even if immediate updates fail

3. **Team ID Consistency**
   - Verified that all HTML elements use `team.team_id` consistently
   - The form's `teamId` field is correctly set when logging goals for team members
   - The `updateTeamAfterGoals` function receives the correct team ID parameter

## Verification Tests

A comprehensive testing suite has been created to verify the fixes:

1. **test-team-updates-final.js**

   - Verifies team ID consistency across all team elements
   - Tests the update functions directly to ensure they work
   - Simulates a goal submission to test the complete flow

2. **team-goal-logging-test.html**
   - Standalone test page that can be used to manually verify updates
   - Tests both `updateTeamAfterGoals` and `updateTeamMaxKicks` functions
   - Simulates form submission and UI updates

## Expected Behavior

After a goal is logged for a team member:

1. The team's score is updated immediately by adding the number of goals scored
2. The team's total kicks is updated immediately by adding the number of kicks used
3. The leaderboard is refreshed to show the updated standings
4. The team card continues to display the correct totals even after refreshes

When 11 players are selected for a team with more than 11 members:

1. The team's maximum kicks is updated to show `/55` (for 11 players with 5 kicks each)

## Implementation Notes

- The update functions target elements by ID using the pattern `team-score-{teamId}` and `team-kicks-{teamId}`
- Element IDs use the actual `team.team_id` value (the database ID from the teams table)
- The updateTeamAfterGoals function handles parsing the current values and calculating new values
- Data persistence happens server-side in the logCompetitionGoals controller

## Verification Steps

1. Open a competition live page with teams
2. Inspect team cards to verify consistent team IDs
3. Click "View Team Members" for a team
4. Log goals for a team member
5. Verify that the team's score and kicks update immediately
6. Verify that the leaderboard updates after refresh
7. For teams with >11 members, verify the total kicks updates to `/55` after selecting 11 players

The issue has been resolved and all UI updates now work correctly for both individual participants and team members.
