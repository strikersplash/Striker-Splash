# QR Scanner UI Fix

## Issue

In the competition setup interface, the QR scanner was overlapping with other UI elements when activated. The QR scanner needed to be styled consistently with the cashier interface and properly contained within its designated area.

## Solution

The QR scanner in the competition setup page has been improved with the following changes:

1. **Better Containment**:

   - Increased height from 200px to 300px to match the cashier interface
   - Added proper positioning to ensure the scanner stays within its container
   - Fixed overflow issues to prevent overlapping with other elements

2. **Enhanced Visual Design**:

   - Added corner markers for better scanning visual guidance
   - Improved scanner container with proper background color
   - Added a placeholder when the scanner is not active
   - Made the scanner interface consistent with the rest of the application

3. **Improved Interaction**:

   - Enhanced the scanner initialization and cleanup process
   - Added better error handling for camera permissions
   - Improved visual feedback during scanning

4. **Technical Changes**:
   - Added CSS overrides to handle the HTML5-QRCode library's default styling
   - Improved DOM manipulation for scanner creation and removal
   - Added proper z-index management to ensure correct stacking order

## Testing Notes

The QR scanner now:

- Maintains its position within the designated container
- Has a consistent look and feel with the cashier interface
- Shows proper visual guidance markers during scanning
- Displays a placeholder when not in use

This fix ensures that the competition setup interface provides a better user experience when scanning player QR codes.

## Future Improvements

Consider extracting the QR scanner implementation into a reusable component to ensure consistency across all interfaces.
