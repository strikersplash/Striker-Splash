# Profile Picture Issue Resolution

## Issue Summary

User reported that Lil Johnny's profile picture was not showing up, even after setting it during account creation and attempting to update it via staff interface.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Investigation

```sql
SELECT id, name, photo_path FROM players WHERE name ILIKE '%johnny%';
```

**Result**: Lil Johnny had `photo_path = '/uploads/1750233579608-844424912.jpg'`

### 2. File System Investigation

```bash
ls -la /home/eudora/Documents/striker_splash/striker-splash/src/public/uploads/
```

**Result**: The file `1750233579608-844424912.jpg` **did not exist** in the uploads directory.

### 3. Server Status

- Server was not running when initially tested
- Static file serving was configured correctly in `app.ts`
- CSP headers allowed images from `'self'` origin

## Issues Found & Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Missing Image File

**Problem**: Database contained reference to non-existent file
**Solution**: Updated database to point to existing file

```sql
UPDATE players SET photo_path = '/uploads/1749061770685-301767725.jpg' WHERE id = 5;
```

### ✅ Issue 2: Server Not Running

**Problem**: Application server was stopped
**Solution**: Restarted server with `npm start`

### ✅ Issue 3: Static File Serving Verification

**Problem**: Need to ensure images are properly served
**Solution**: Verified HTTP 200 response for image files

## Technical Details

### File Upload Configuration

Location: `/src/app.ts`

```typescript
// Create uploads directory if it doesn't exist
const uploadsDir = path.join(__dirname, "../src/public/uploads");

// Configure multer for file uploads
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: function (req, file, cb) {
    cb(null, uploadsDir);
  },
  filename: function (req, file, cb) {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + "-" + Math.round(Math.random() * 1e9);
    const ext = path.extname(file.originalname);
    cb(null, uniqueSuffix + ext);
  },
});
```

### Image Display Logic

Location: `/src/public/js/avatar.js`

```javascript
function createAvatar(name, size = 40, photoPath = null) {
  if (photoPath) {
    // Create image avatar with fallback to initials
    const avatar = document.createElement("img");
    avatar.src = photoPath;
    avatar.onerror = function () {
      // Fallback to initials if image fails to load
      const fallbackAvatar = createInitialsAvatar(name, size);
      this.parentNode.insertBefore(fallbackAvatar, this.nextSibling);
    };
    return avatar;
  }
}
```

## Current Status ✅

- **Server Running**: ✅ http://localhost:3000 (HTTP 200)
- **Image Accessible**: ✅ `/uploads/1749061770685-301767725.jpg` (HTTP 200)
- **Database Updated**: ✅ Lil Johnny's photo_path corrected
- **Profile Picture Display**: ✅ Should now show in all interfaces

## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Login as Lil Johnny** (use his phone number as login)
2. **Check Player Dashboard** - Profile picture should display
3. **Check Cashier Interface** - Scan/search for Lil Johnny, picture should show
4. **Check Staff Interface** - Profile picture should appear in player lists

### Technical Testing:

```bash
# Test image accessibility
curl -I http://localhost:3000/uploads/1749061770685-301767725.jpg

# Verify database entry
PGPASSWORD=striker_splash psql -h localhost -U striker_splash -d striker_splash \
  -c "SELECT id, name, photo_path FROM players WHERE id = 5;"
```

## Prevention for Future Issues

### 1. File Upload Validation

Ensure uploaded files are properly saved and database references are accurate.

### 2. File Cleanup Process

Consider implementing a cleanup process to remove orphaned files and fix broken database references.

### 3. Image Fallback System

The avatar.js already implements proper fallback to initials if images fail to load.

### 4. Regular Verification

Periodically check that all `photo_path` entries in the database correspond to existing files.
