# Team Selection Display Fix

## Issue

Users were getting the error "Please add at least one more team. Competitions require a minimum of 2 teams." even after trying to add teams to a competition.

## Root Cause

The `updateSelectedTeamsDisplay()` function was being called in the `addTeam()` function but was never defined. This meant:

1. When teams were added via `addTeam(team)`, they were correctly pushed to the `selectedTeams` array
2. However, the call to `updateSelectedTeamsDisplay()` would throw a JavaScript error
3. The error would prevent the UI from updating to show the selected teams
4. Users couldn't see that their teams were actually selected
5. When trying to create the competition, the validation would sometimes fail due to the UI state being inconsistent

## Solution

Added the missing `updateSelectedTeamsDisplay()` function that:

1. **Updates the UI** to show all selected teams in a card format
2. **Displays team information** including name, captain, and member count
3. **Provides remove functionality** with a "Remove" button for each team
4. **Handles empty state** by showing a helpful message when no teams are selected
5. **Cleans up data** when teams are removed (removes team members and selected players data)

## Implementation Details

### The new function:

```javascript
function updateSelectedTeamsDisplay() {
  const selectedTeamsContainer = document.getElementById("selected-teams");
  if (!selectedTeamsContainer) return;

  if (selectedTeams.length === 0) {
    selectedTeamsContainer.innerHTML = `
      <div class="col-12 text-center text-muted">
        <p>No teams selected yet. Use search to add teams.</p>
      </div>
    `;
    return;
  }

  let html = "";
  selectedTeams.forEach((team, index) => {
    html += `
      <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-4 mb-3">
        <div class="card">
          <div class="card-body">
            <h6 class="card-title">${team.name}</h6>
            <p class="card-text mb-1">
              <small class="text-muted">Captain: ${
                team.captain_name || "N/A"
              }</small>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text mb-2">
              <small class="text-muted">Members: ${
                team.member_count || 0
              }</small>
            </p>
            <button type="button" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger" onclick="removeTeam(${index})">
              Remove
            </button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    `;
  });

  selectedTeamsContainer.innerHTML = html;
}
```

### Supporting function:

```javascript
function removeTeam(index) {
  if (index >= 0 && index < selectedTeams.length) {
    const removedTeam = selectedTeams[index];
    selectedTeams.splice(index, 1);

    // Clean up team members data
    if (teamMembers[removedTeam.id]) {
      delete teamMembers[removedTeam.id];
    }
    if (selectedTeamPlayers[removedTeam.id]) {
      delete selectedTeamPlayers[removedTeam.id];
    }

    updateSelectedTeamsDisplay();
  }
}
```

## Testing

After applying this fix:

1. Users can now add teams and see them displayed immediately
2. Teams can be removed if added by mistake
3. The competition creation process should work correctly with proper team validation
4. The UI provides clear feedback about which teams are selected

The server has been restarted with these changes and should now work correctly.
