# SECURITY FIX: Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (CVE-STRIKER-2025-001)

## **VULNERABILITY DISCOVERED**

### **Issue**: Player Profile Authentication Bypass via Name Collisions

- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Discovery Date**: January 28, 2025
- **Reporter**: System audit during raffle feature development

### **Description**

A critical authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in the player dashboard routing system. When multiple players share identical names, the SEO-friendly URL routing system could allow one player to access another player's profile and sensitive information.

### **Root Cause**

1. **SEO-Friendly URLs**: Dashboard URLs were generated using player names (e.g., `/player/dashboard/john-smith`)
2. **Ambiguous Routing**: Multiple players with identical names generated identical URL slugs
3. **Insecure Lookup**: `Player.findBySlug()` returned the first matching player, not necessarily the authenticated user
4. **Missing Ownership Verification**: No verification that the requested profile belonged to the authenticated user

### **Attack Vector**

```
1. Player A ("John Doe") logs in successfully with phone 07700900001
2. Player B ("John Doe") exists with phone 07700900002
3. Player A accesses /player/dashboard/john-doe
4. System returns Player B's dashboard due to ambiguous lookup
5. Player A can view Player B's private information, stats, QR codes, etc.
```

## **SECURITY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Secure Dashboard Routing**

**File**: `src/controllers/player/playerController.ts`

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ Always verify profile ownership before display
- ‚úÖ Restrict access to authenticated user's own dashboard only
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive ownership verification for slug-based URLs
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error messages and secure redirects

```typescript
// BEFORE (VULNERABLE):
if (player.id !== playerId) {
  // Weak check after insecure lookup
}

// AFTER (SECURE):
if (!foundPlayer || foundPlayer.id !== loggedInPlayerId) {
  req.flash("error_msg", "You can only view your own dashboard");
  return res.redirect("/player/dashboard");
}
```

### **2. Enhanced Slug Security**

**File**: `src/models/Player.ts`

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ Added duplicate detection in `findBySlug()`
- ‚úÖ Returns `null` if multiple players share the same slug
- ‚úÖ Logs security warnings for duplicate slug attempts
- ‚úÖ Forces fallback to authenticated-based access

```typescript
// NEW SECURITY CHECK:
if (matchingPlayers.length > 1) {
  console.warn(`SECURITY ALERT: Multiple players found with slug "${slug}"`);
  return null; // Prevent ambiguous access
}
```

### **3. Secure Navigation**

**Files**: `src/views/partials/navbar.ejs`, `src/views/layouts/main.ejs`

**Changes**:

- ‚úÖ Removed name-based URL generation from navigation
- ‚úÖ Updated dashboard links to use secure `/player/dashboard` route
- ‚úÖ Eliminated client-side slug generation vulnerability

```html
<!-- BEFORE (VULNERABLE): -->
href="/player/dashboard/<%= user.name.toLowerCase().replace(...) %>"

<!-- AFTER (SECURE): -->
href="/player/dashboard"
```

### **4. Audit and Monitoring Tools**

**Created Scripts**:

- ‚úÖ `audit-duplicate-names.js` - Security audit for duplicate names
- ‚úÖ `fix-duplicate-names.js` - Interactive duplicate resolution tool
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging for security events

## **VERIFICATION AND TESTING**

### **Security Test Cases**

1. ‚úÖ **Duplicate Name Access Test**: Players with identical names cannot access each other's dashboards
2. ‚úÖ **URL Manipulation Test**: Direct URL access to other profiles is blocked
3. ‚úÖ **Slug Collision Test**: Ambiguous slugs return secure error responses
4. ‚úÖ **Navigation Security Test**: All navigation links use secure routing

### **Functional Test Cases**

1. ‚úÖ **Normal Dashboard Access**: Authenticated users can access their own dashboards
2. ‚úÖ **SEO URLs Still Work**: Legitimate slug-based URLs function for single matches
3. ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages for security violations
4. ‚úÖ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved

## **ADDITIONAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS**

### **Immediate Actions**

1. ‚úÖ **Deploy Security Fixes**: All critical fixes implemented and ready for deployment
2. üîÑ **Run Security Audit**: Execute `audit-duplicate-names.js` on production database
3. ‚è≥ **Resolve Duplicates**: Use `fix-duplicate-names.js` to address existing duplicates
4. ‚è≥ **Monitor Logs**: Check for security warning messages about duplicate slugs

### **Future Enhancements**

1. **Database Constraints**: Add unique constraints on normalized names
2. **Registration Validation**: Check for existing names during player registration
3. **Alternative Identifiers**: Consider phone-based or ID-based URLs for guaranteed uniqueness
4. **Security Headers**: Implement additional security headers for profile pages

## **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **Security Impact**

- ‚ùå **Before Fix**: High-risk authentication bypass vulnerability
- ‚úÖ **After Fix**: Secure player profile access with ownership verification
- üõ°Ô∏è **Risk Reduction**: Complete elimination of name-based authentication bypass

### **User Experience Impact**

- ‚úÖ **Maintained Functionality**: All legitimate dashboard access preserved
- ‚úÖ **Better Error Messages**: Clear security error messages for violations
- ‚úÖ **Simplified Navigation**: Cleaner URLs in navigation menus
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor Change**: Users can no longer manually craft SEO URLs for profile access

## **DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

- [x] Code fixes implemented and tested
- [x] Security audit script created
- [x] Documentation completed
- [ ] Deploy to production server
- [ ] Run security audit on production database
- [ ] Monitor application logs for security warnings
- [ ] Verify all navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Test with real user scenarios

## **RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE**

This vulnerability was discovered during internal development and has been immediately patched. No external disclosure was necessary as the system is in active development with controlled access.

**Fix Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Critical authentication bypass vulnerability eliminated
