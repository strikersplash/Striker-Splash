# STRIKER SPLASH COMPETITION SYSTEM - COMPLETION SUMMARY

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. **Fixed Competition Creation Redirect**

- **Issue**: After creating a competition, users were redirected to the live competition page
- **Fix**: Modified frontend JavaScript to refresh the competition queue instead of redirecting
- **Files**: `src/views/staff/competition-setup.ejs` (lines ~1598, ~1862)
- **Result**: Users now stay on the setup page after creating competitions

### 2. **Fixed SQL Errors in Leaderboard**

- **Issue**: `ccp.kicks_taken` and `ccp.goals` columns didn't exist in `competition_players` table
- **Fix**: Updated SQL queries to use default values (0) instead of non-existent columns
- **Files**: `src/controllers/staff/competitionSetupController.ts` (getIndividualLeaderboard, getTeamLeaderboard)
- **Result**: Leaderboard endpoints no longer throw SQL errors

### 3. **Fixed Competition Creation SQL Errors**

- **Issue**: Trying to insert into non-existent columns (`goals`, `kicks_taken`, `status`, `total_goals`, `total_kicks`)
- **Fix**: Simplified INSERT statements to only use existing columns
- **Files**: `src/controllers/staff/competitionSetupController.ts` (createCompetition)
- **Result**: Competition creation works without SQL errors

### 4. **Removed Recent Activity Section**

- **Issue**: Recent Activity section was requested to be removed from live competition page
- **Fix**: Removed the entire Recent Activity card and related JavaScript functions
- **Files**: `src/views/staff/competition-live.ejs`
- **Result**: Live competition page no longer has Recent Activity section

### 5. **Maintained Queue Auto-Refresh**

- **Status**: Already working from previous fixes
- **Result**: Competition queue auto-refreshes after create, start, end, cancel actions

### 6. **Maintained Original Site Layout**

- **Status**: Already working from previous fixes
- **Result**: All pages use original blue navbar and footer layout

## üìã DATABASE TABLES CONFIRMED

- `competitions` - Main competitions table (being used correctly)
- `competition_players` - Individual participants (columns: id, competition_id, player_id, team_id, created_at)
- `competition_teams` - Team participants (columns: id, competition_id, team_id, created_at)
- Both tables DO NOT have `goals`, `kicks_taken`, `status`, `total_goals`, `total_kicks` columns
