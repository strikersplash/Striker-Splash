# Player Dashboard - Best Consecutive Kicks Feature

## Feature Overview

Added a "Best Consecutive Kicks" personal record display to the player dashboard that shows each player's highest consecutive kicks achievement.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Controller Enhancement

**File**: `src/controllers/player/playerController.ts`

Added query to fetch the player's best consecutive kicks record:

```typescript
// Get best consecutive kicks
let bestConsecutiveKicks = 0;
try {
  const consecutiveQuery = `
    SELECT 
      COALESCE(MAX(consecutive_kicks), 0) as best_consecutive
    FROM 
      game_stats
    WHERE 
      player_id = $1 
      AND consecutive_kicks IS NOT NULL
  `;

  const consecutiveResult = await pool.query(consecutiveQuery, [playerId]);
  bestConsecutiveKicks = consecutiveResult.rows[0]?.best_consecutive || 0;
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Error fetching best consecutive kicks:", error);
  // Graceful fallback if consecutive_kicks column doesn't exist
  bestConsecutiveKicks = 0;
}

// Add best consecutive kicks to stats
stats.best_consecutive_kicks = bestConsecutiveKicks;
```

### 2. Frontend Dashboard Enhancement

**File**: `src/views/player/dashboard.ejs`

Added a new stats card to display the personal record:

```html
<div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
  <div class="card text-center bg-light">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">
        <i class="bi bi-trophy"></i> Best Consecutive Kicks
      </h5>
      <h2 class="text-warning">
        <% if (stats.best_consecutive_kicks && stats.best_consecutive_kicks > 0)
        { %> <%= stats.best_consecutive_kicks %> <% } else { %>
        <span class="text-muted">N/A</span>
        <% } %>
      </h2>
      <small class="text-muted">Personal Record</small>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

## Features

## Usage

Players can now see their best consecutive kicks achievement on their personal dashboard:

2. **After Records**: Shows their highest consecutive kicks number
3. **Real-Time**: Updates automatically when they beat their record

## Technical Notes

- **Database**: Uses existing `game_stats.consecutive_kicks` column
- **Calculation**: Dynamic calculation via MAX() aggregation
