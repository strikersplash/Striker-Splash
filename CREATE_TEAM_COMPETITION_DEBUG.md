# Create Team Competition Button Debug Fix

## Issue

The "Create Team Competition" button is not working when clicked, even though teams are properly selected and displayed.

## Investigation

I found that:

1. **The button is properly structured** as a `type="submit"` button inside a form with `id="team-competition-form"`
2. **The form event listener is being added** during DOMContentLoaded
3. **The validation function exists** and is properly named `validateAndCreateTeamCompetition`

## Debugging Added

I've added console logging to help identify the exact issue:

1. **Form element detection**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Team form element found:", teamForm);
   ```

2. **Event listener confirmation**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Team form submit event listener added");
   ```

3. **Form submission detection**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("Team form submitted!");
   ```

4. **Function execution confirmation**:

   ```javascript
   console.log("validateAndCreateTeamCompetition called");
   ```

5. **Form values logging**:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Form values:", {
     teamSize,
     cost,
     kicks,
     maxTeams,
     description,
   });
   ```

## Next Steps for Testing

When you test the Create Team Competition button:

1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. **Go to the Console tab**
3. **Try clicking the "Create Team Competition" button**
4. **Check the console messages** to see where the process stops:

   - If you see "Team form element found: [object HTMLFormElement]" → Form is found ✓
   - If you see "Team form submit event listener added" → Event listener is attached ✓
   - If you see "Team form submitted!" → Form submission is working ✓
   - If you see "validateAndCreateTeamCompetition called" → Function is executing ✓
   - If you see "Form values: {...}" → Values are being read ✓

## Possible Issues

Based on what appears in the console, the issue could be:

1. **Form not found** → The form element doesn't exist or has wrong ID
2. **Event listener not added** → JavaScript error preventing event attachment
3. **Form not submitting** → Button click not triggering form submission
4. **Function not executing** → JavaScript error in the validation function
5. **Values not readable** → Form field IDs don't match expected names

## Manual Workaround

If debugging shows the issue is with event listeners, you can test by running this in the browser console:

```javascript
validateAndCreateTeamCompetition();
```

This will directly call the function and bypass any event listener issues.

## Server Status

The server needs to be restarted to apply the debugging changes. The debug messages will help identify exactly where the button click process is failing.
