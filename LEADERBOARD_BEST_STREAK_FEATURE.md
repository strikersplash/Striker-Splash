# Leaderboard - Best Streak Column Feature

## Feature Overview

Added a "Best Streak" column to the main leaderboard that displays each player's highest consecutive kicks achievement, encouraging competitive streaks and showcasing exceptional performance.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend Controller Enhancement

**File**: `src/controllers/leaderboard/leaderboardController.ts`

The leaderboard query already includes the consecutive kicks calculation:

```typescript
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.name,
  p.residence,
  p.city_village,
  p.gender,
  p.age_group,
  SUM(gs.goals) as total_goals,
  COUNT(gs.id) * 5 as total_attempts,
  COALESCE(MAX(gs.consecutive_kicks), 0) as best_streak,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT s.name, ', ') as referees
FROM
  game_stats gs
JOIN
  players p ON gs.player_id = p.id
-- Additional joins and filters...
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.residence, p.city_village, p.gender, p.age_group
ORDER BY total_goals DESC
```

### 2. Frontend Leaderboard Enhancement

**File**: `src/views/leaderboard/index.ejs`

Added "Best Streak" column to the leaderboard table:

#### Table Header:

```html
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Rank</th>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Location</th>
    <th>Gender</th>
    <th>Age Group</th>
    <th>Goals</th>
    <th>Attempts</th>
    <th>Best Streak</th>
    <!-- New column -->
    <th>Percentile</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
```

#### Table Data:

```html
<td>
  <% if (player.best_streak && player.best_streak > 0) { %>
  <span class="badge bg-warning">
    <i class="bi bi-fire"></i> <%= player.best_streak %>
  </span>
  <% } else { %>
  <span class="text-muted">-</span>
  <% } %>
</td>
```

## Features

### âœ… Visual Design

- **Fire Icon**: Uses `bi-fire` icon to represent "hot streak"
- **Warning Badge**: Orange/yellow badge color to highlight achievements
- **Fallback Display**: Shows "-" when no consecutive kicks recorded
- **Responsive**: Integrates seamlessly with existing table design

### âœ… Data Accuracy

- **MAX Aggregation**: Shows highest consecutive kicks across all games
- **Real-time**: Updates automatically when new records are set
- **Null Handling**: COALESCE ensures 0 instead of NULL for clean display
- **Official Games Only**: Only counts official competition games

### âœ… User Experience

- **Motivational**: Encourages players to build and maintain streaks
- **Competitive**: Adds another dimension to leaderboard rankings
- **Clear Labeling**: "Best Streak" is concise and self-explanatory
- **Visual Appeal**: Fire icon makes achievements stand out

### âœ… Technical Implementation

- **Performance**: Single aggregated query with existing data
- **Backwards Compatible**: Works with existing leaderboard infrastructure
- **Filter Support**: Respects existing gender/age/location filters
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shows "-" for players without streak data

## Usage Examples

### Leaderboard Display:

```
Rank | Name     | Location | Gender | Age    | Goals | Attempts | Best Streak | Percentile
1    | Alice    | City A   | Female | 20-25  | 45    | 50       | ðŸ”¥ 8        | Top 10%
2    | Bob      | City B   | Male   | 26-30  | 42    | 50       | ðŸ”¥ 5        | Top 10%
3    | Charlie  | City C   | Male   | 18-20  | 38    | 45       | -           | Top 25%
```

### Features in Action:

- **High Streaks**: Players with 6+ consecutive kicks get prominent fire badge
- **Moderate Streaks**: 3-5 consecutive kicks still show with fire icon
- **No Streaks**: Players without consecutive kicks show clean "-" dash
- **Sorting**: Leaderboard still sorts by total goals (primary metric)

## Benefits

### For Players:

- **Recognition**: Streak achievements are publicly visible
- **Motivation**: Encourages building and maintaining consecutive kicks
- **Competition**: Adds another way to stand out on leaderboard
- **Goal Setting**: Clear target for improving performance

### For Administrators:

- **Engagement**: Additional metric to celebrate player achievements
- **Analytics**: Insights into player consistency and skill
- **Competition**: More dimensions for tournaments and challenges
- **Retention**: Gives players another reason to keep playing

## Technical Notes

- **Database**: Uses existing `game_stats.consecutive_kicks` column
- **Query Performance**: Efficient MAX() aggregation in single query
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - just one additional field in result set
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for missing consecutive_kicks data
- **Scalability**: Performs well with large datasets due to proper indexing
