# Events Display User Experience Fix

## Issue

When there was an error loading events from the API on the About Us page, the system would display a technical error message: "Error loading events. Please try again." This message is not very user-friendly and might confuse visitors.

## Solution

Modified the error handling code to display a more user-friendly message when events cannot be loaded from the API. Instead of showing an error message, we now show the same message that would be displayed when there are no events:

"No upcoming events scheduled at this time. Check back soon!"

## Changes Made

1. Updated the error handling in `public/js/events.js` to show a user-friendly message
2. Made the same update in `public/js/events-fixed.js` for consistency

### Before:

```javascript
.catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error loading events:", error);
  eventsLoading.style.display = "none";
  eventsContainer.style.display = "block";
  noEvents.style.display = "block";
  noEvents.innerHTML =
    '<p class="text-danger">Error loading events. Please try again.</p>';
});
```

### After:

```javascript
.catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error loading events:", error);
  eventsLoading.style.display = "none";
  eventsContainer.style.display = "block";
  noEvents.style.display = "block";
  noEvents.innerHTML =
    '<p>No upcoming events scheduled at this time. Check back soon!</p>';
});
```

## Benefits

- More user-friendly experience when events can't be loaded
- Consistent messaging whether there are no events or there was an error loading events
- Avoids technical language that might confuse non-technical users
- Maintains the error logging in the console for debugging purposes

## Testing

To test this change:

1. Visit the About Us page
2. If there are no events or if there's an API error, the message should now read "No upcoming events scheduled at this time. Check back soon!"
