# Competition Setup Buttons Fix

## Issue

The "Setup Individual Competition" and "Setup Team Competition" buttons on the competition setup page were not working correctly. Users were unable to click these buttons to proceed with setting up competitions.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was related to how the JavaScript event handlers were being attached to the buttons:

1. The `selectCompetitionType` function was defined with syntax errors that prevented proper execution
2. Event listeners were being added during DOMContentLoaded, but there might have been timing issues or other script errors preventing proper initialization.
3. There was no fallback handling for when the event listeners failed to attach correctly.

## Changes Made (Updated After Initial Fix)

### 1. Fixed JavaScript syntax errors

Corrected syntax errors in the global function definition:

```javascript
// Fixed from incorrect IIFE pattern
window.selectCompetitionType = function (type) {
  // function implementation
};
```

### 2. Implemented an emergency direct button handler

Created a new direct button handler that bypasses all existing code:

```javascript
window.handleCompetitionButtonClick = function (type) {
  // Hide all sections
  document
    .querySelectorAll(".competition-setup-section")
    .forEach(function (section) {
      section.style.display = "none";
    });

  // Show the target section
  var targetSection = document.getElementById(type + "-setup");
  if (targetSection) targetSection.style.display = "block";
};
```

### 3. Updated button click handlers

Changed the button onclick attributes to use our new emergency handler:

```html
<button
  type="button"
  class="btn btn-primary setup-competition-btn"
  data-type="individual"
  onclick="return handleCompetitionButtonClick('individual');"
>
  Setup Individual Competition
</button>
```

### 4. Added isolated emergency script

Added a completely isolated script that runs independently at the end of the document:

```javascript
// Emergency fix for competition buttons
(function () {
  console.log("EMERGENCY FIX: Setting up competition buttons directly");

  // Define button handler globally
  window.handleCompetitionButtonClick = function (type) {
    // Implementation that works independently
  };

  // Apply click handlers directly after a short delay
  setTimeout(function () {
    var individualBtn = document.querySelector(
      'button[data-type="individual"]'
    );
    var teamBtn = document.querySelector('button[data-type="team"]');

    if (individualBtn) {
      individualBtn.onclick = function () {
        return handleCompetitionButtonClick("individual");
      };
    }

    if (teamBtn) {
      teamBtn.onclick = function () {
        return handleCompetitionButtonClick("team");
      };
    }
  }, 100);
})();
```

### 5. Added recovery mechanism

Added a global `window.fixCompetitionButtons()` function that can be called from the browser console if needed to restore button functionality.

## Testing

The server has been restarted with these changes. The competition setup buttons should now work correctly. If users encounter any issues, they can:

1. Refresh the page and try again
2. Open the browser console (F12) and run `window.fixCompetitionButtons()`

## Future Considerations

- Consider reviewing other event handlers on the competition setup page for similar issues
- Add error monitoring to detect and report JavaScript errors that might affect user experience
- Consider implementing more robust event delegation patterns for better reliability
