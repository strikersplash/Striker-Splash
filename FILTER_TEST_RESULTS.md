# Leaderboard Filter Test Results

## Test Date: July 9, 2025

### Backend Testing (Direct URL Access)

✅ **WORKING**: Backend correctly receives and processes filter parameters when accessed via direct URL
✅ **WORKING**: SQL queries properly filter results based on parameters
✅ **WORKING**: Gender filter correctly returns only players of specified gender

Example successful test:

- URL: `http://localhost:3000/leaderboard?gender=female&type=individual`
- Backend logs show: `gender: 'female', type: 'individual'`
- SQL query: `AND p.gender = $1` with params: `['female']`
- Results: 8 female players returned (all with gender='female')

### Frontend Form Submission Testing

❓ **NEEDS TESTING**: Hidden form submission through Apply Filters button

The issue appears to be with the frontend form submission mechanism, not the backend processing.

### Next Steps

1. Test the Apply Filters button functionality
2. Verify hidden form values are populated correctly
3. Confirm form submission sends parameters to backend
4. Check for any JavaScript errors preventing form submission

### Known Issues

- CSS loading error: `competition-modal-fix.css` returns HTML content instead of CSS (MIME type mismatch)
- This might be causing JavaScript execution issues
