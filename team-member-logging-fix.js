console.log("üêõ PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:");
console.log("  - Team member logging was missing competitionId field");
console.log("  - Form validation was failing because competitionId was empty");
console.log(
  "  - Individual participant logging worked because openLogGoalsModal sets competitionId"
);
console.log("  - Team member logging didn't set competitionId in the form");
console.log("");

console.log("üîß SOLUTION APPLIED:");
console.log("  - Added competitionIdInput to team member logging flow");
console.log("  - Set competitionId from URL in team member click handler");
console.log("  - Added form field reset to ensure clean state");
console.log("  - Added debug logging to track form population");
console.log("");

console.log("‚úÖ TEAM MEMBER LOGGING FLOW:");
console.log("  1. Click 'View Team Members' button");
console.log("  2. Click 'Log Goals' button for a team member");
console.log("  3. Form gets populated with:");
console.log("     - participantId: Member ID");
console.log("     - playerName: Member name");
console.log("     - competitionId: From URL (82)");
console.log("     - teamId: From button attribute");
console.log("     - kicksUsed: Default 5");
console.log("     - goalsScored: Default 0");
console.log("");

console.log("‚úÖ VALIDATION SHOULD NOW PASS:");
console.log("  - participantId: ‚úÖ Set from memberId");
console.log("  - competitionId: ‚úÖ Set from URL");
console.log("  - kicksUsed: ‚úÖ Set to 5 (valid number)");
console.log("  - goalsScored: ‚úÖ Set to 0 (valid number)");
console.log("");

console.log("üîß TESTING STEPS:");
console.log("  1. Go to competition live page");
console.log("  2. Click 'View Team Members' for any team");
console.log("  3. Click 'Log Goals' for any team member");
console.log("  4. Check browser console for debug log");
console.log("  5. Verify form fields are populated correctly");
console.log("  6. Try submitting the form");
console.log("  7. Should work without 'required fields' error");
